# Pentia Chat
Pentia Chat is a basic cross-platform chat application developed in React Native,
using Expo for its ease of development and deployment features.
This project was a technical showcase created for Pentia,
demonstrating basic functionalities of a chat app.

They did not currently have an open position, so while I wait for them to have an opening,
I've decided to make this project public to showcase to other potential employers.
I'm always open to additional tests or interviews to demonstrate my skills further.


## Description
Pentia Chat offers a straightforward chat experience across both iOS and Android platforms. Utilizing React Native and Expo, it includes essential features like signing in with Facebook or Google, joining chat rooms, and sharing images. This app serves as an example of my capability to build cross-platform applications with a focus on functionality and user experience.


## Features
- Sign-in with Google or Facebook.
- Access to predefined chat rooms.
- Send messages and share images from the camera or gallery.
- Opt-in notifications for new messages in chat rooms.
